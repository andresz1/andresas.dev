  summary:
    "I'm a Software Developer with experience in Server, Network and Hosting Management, Data Modeling, Business Logic, User Interface and User Experience. I'm mainly focused on Web and Mobile Development. A huge part of my work experience is related with it. I feel comfortable developing both Front-End and Back-End. I define myself as a creative, dedicated and responsable person who likes challenges. I'm an optimist rather than a pessimist, but I'm also a realist. I enjoy learning new things and sharing my knowledges.",
